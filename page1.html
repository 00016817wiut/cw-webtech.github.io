      <p>
        MAXIMA radio station conducts daily round-the-clock broadcasting on FM
        frequency-105.4 MHz. The language of broadcasting is Russian.
        <br />
        Broadcasting is carried out using modern high-tech studio equipment and
        transmitting equipment that meet international standards. Broadcasting
        coverage - Tashkent, Tashkent region.
        <br />
        The AS Soft format, in which MAXIMA radio broadcasts, includes the best
        works of world pop music of the 80s and 90s, and is designed for
        25-60-year-old radio listeners. The percentage of music of the 80s and
        90s refers to 40-30, 30 percent reflect the novelties of modern pop.
        <br />
        This format also includes news, reviews, short thematic sketches.
        Currently, the verbal broadcast occupies 10-15 percent of the broadcast
        network.
        <br />
        Much attention is paid on the air to social projects, including
        "Lullabies of the Planet", "Music of our Parents", social videos
        covering the most pressing aspects of our lives – environmental
        protection, care for the older generation, education of healthy youth.
        We try to avoid hackneyed cliches, so we do not always resort to
        standard lighting methods, because sometimes just a lullaby can stir up
        people's feelings and remind them of parents who need our support and
        care. And if this happens, then we are on the right track.
        <br />
        Thanks to the excellent mood from the very beginning of the day, members
        of our society working in various fields begin to increase their
        productivity, mothers and grandmothers will cook the most delicious
        lunch to the sounds of our wave, which will fill their beloved home with
        the aroma of warmth and comfort, drivers charging with positive energy
        of radio frequencies will improve the quality of service. But how much
        does it mean in our lives…
        <br />
        Over the years, such famous people as Alisher Kanaev, Lola Islamova,
        Leila Izmailova, D.Vilya (Vildan Gataulin) have worked on our wave. Each
        of them has brought something of their own to the development of our
        radio station and for this we are immensely grateful to them. But we do
        not stop on our way, and every year we are looking for new approaches in
        order to become even better, better and more interesting. And the love
        of our radio listeners is the best confirmation that we are on the right
        track.
